# Complete and Await Reply

Mark the currently selected task as complete and add a new task to await the reply.

This script is based on the script from [OMNI-AUTOMATION.COM](https://omni-automation.com/omnifocus/plug-in-complete-await.html)

> It allows you to mark your currently selected task as complete, and duplicates the task with `Waiting on reply:` prefixed to the original task name.

Some update:

- Append reply time to the end of duplicated task's note,
- No more `Waiting on reply: Waiting on reply:` in the duplicated task's name.
